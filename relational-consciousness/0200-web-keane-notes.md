I agree with much of what I read here and am considering what a semiotic anthropology might contribute.  So here are a few very sketchy initial thoughts, offered in full awareness each point is defeasible.

1. The question "what is consciousness?" is often posed because the answer seems to be a precondition for the ethical question, "can entity X suffer harm?"

2. Harm is not the same as damage.  Arguably, to suffer harm, there must be a self.

3. For there to be a self, the must be more than consciousness, there must be self-consciousness.

4. Self-consciousness requires an encounter with a non-self.

5. In human development, the encounter with non-self has two crucial features: (a) a capacity to take the non-self's (or "other's") view of the self, in other words, to see oneself from the "outside";  (b) Theory of Mind.  These are interdependent.

6. The non-self's viewpoint is situated (it is not a god's eye view) and is significant (the viewpoint is not a merely speculative question, it really matters to the self).

7. Relations between self and non-self are semiotically mediated. Two implications of this are (a) in human social life, semiosis depends on abductions, which are never certain and always revisable over time; (b) human semiosis and its abductions possess certain irreducibly local features that cannot be fully universalized: variation is not superficial or accidental, it's a feature not a bug

8. Full-fledged ethical judgment (and, by hypothesis, the capacity to know one is harmed) requires the possibility of giving an account of oneself to another, which depends on local forms and norms of semiotic mediation.

9. Thus (human) (self-)consciousness and ethics are fundamentally properties of social interaction.  (Points 5-7 are developed in my previous book, Ethical Life: Its Natural and Social Histories, Princeton 2016)

10. One form that these processes take is "anthropomorphism," which, arguably, is an inescapable feature of ethical life, meaning, it is a name for how we come to project (self-)consciousness and ethical relevance onto others.

Some classic background texts not commonly appearing in the canon of analytic philosophy:

Charles Sanders Peirce on abduction and on semiosis
George Herbert Mead on the significant other
L.S. Vygotsky on the internalization of language
Erving Goffman on face-to-face interaction
Elinor Ochs, Bambi Schieffelin and others on non-western child development
Marilyn Strathern on “dividual selves”
Michael Silverstein on indexicality and metapragmatics
Michael Tomasello on social cognition and evolution
